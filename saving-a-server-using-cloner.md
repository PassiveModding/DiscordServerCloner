# Saving a Server using Cloner

## Get the bot <a id="get-the-bot"></a>

1. Invite the bot to the server you wish to save [https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=500791607839162376&scope=bot&permissions=8](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=500791607839162376&scope=bot&permissions=8)â€‹
2. Ensure both you and the bot have administrator permissions in the server
3. Run the command `clone.save` the bot will begin saving the server, don't worry if the bot doesn't attach a file immediately, the process of saving can take some time. Note: if you wish to also save messages, you can either specify a message count per channel for the command ie. `clone.save <messageCount>` to generate a messages file for each channel in the server or use the `clone.savemessages <messageCount>` command instead to generate a messages file for the current channel
4. The bot will attach a `.clone` file along with some stats about the save
5. Download this file to your device and keep it safe
